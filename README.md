## WARNING: Some of these sounds (notably the close strikes) are _considerably loud_ and may startle players! HEADPHONE USERS BEWARE!


# 1018 Immersive Thunder

This mod adds new, much stronger thunder to the game and plays them dynamically based on the playerâ€™s distance from the source. The closer you are, the louder and more intense the sound will be. The farther you are, the softer and more delayed the sound will be. 

This spinoff from Leah's [ImmersiveThunder](https://modrinth.com/mod/immersivethunder) uses clips from [1018 Weather](https://www.youtube.com/@1018weather), notably their video from [August 8th, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TBvfSnv12o).
To make it just a touch more immersive, the close sounds retain 2 channels, so the SoundEngine plays them in their powerful, 3-dimensional glory. It's close enough to the user for both ears to hear it at the same strength, anyway >v<

**Requires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) to work!**
**Sounds best with [Sound Physics Remastered](https://modrinth.com/mod/sound-physics-remastered)**
